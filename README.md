# 🔧 Simple C&C Prototype Modules

A collection of **modular, lightweight C&C components**, each implemented as its own mini-program. Designed to prevent burnout by focusing on small, testable pieces that you can build, refine, and combine over time.

---

## 🎯 Goals & Approach

- **Modular Design**: Build each C&C feature as a standalone component—reduce complexity and mental load.
- **Step-by-Step Development**: Design → implement → test each module before moving to the next.
- **Final Assembly**: Once stable, integrate all modules into a single, cohesive project.

## ⚙️ Build & Test

To build a module independently:

```bash
cd <ModuleName>
make
./<ModuleName>
````
---

## 🧭 How to Use

1. **Implement modules independently**—start with `PEB-based-API-Resolver`, then `Loader`, and so on.
2. **Test each in isolation** before combining.
3. **Integrate in final project**, calling each module's exposed functions.
4. **Expand as needed**: add new C2 transports, task types, obfuscation layers, etc.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

* **Prevents burnout**: small wins keep motivation high.
* **Mix & match modules**: build only what you need, when you need it.
* **Scalable architecture**: easy to add more modules (e.g. DNS, injection, VM obf) later.
* **Supports collaboration**: clear boundaries facilitate teamwork.

## 🏁 Next Step

Start with **`PEB-based-API-Resolver/`**:

* Read its design doc.
* Run `make` and test.
* Then move to `Loader/`, and so on.

Keep the momentum going—build small, test fast, and scale up!
